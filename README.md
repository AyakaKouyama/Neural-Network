# Neural Network
Neural network which approximate sqtr(x) function. Can be easly adapted to approximate any function.
To run program you have to pass arguments:
* number of inputs,
* number of hidden layers,
* number of neurons in hidden layer,
* number of outputs,
* learning error file name (error in every epoch made on learning data set)
* training error file name (error in every epoch made on training data set)

For example (using command line):

<b>-java -jar programm.jar 1 3 3 1 learning.txt training.txt </b>

Program made for univesity purpose.
